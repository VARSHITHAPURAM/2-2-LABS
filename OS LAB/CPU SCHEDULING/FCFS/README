                                         FCFS [FIRST COME FIRST SERVE]


1. First-come, First served is the simplest scheduling algorithm.
2. Ready queue is a FIFO queue.
3. Longest waiting process at the front of queue.
4. New ready processes join the rear.
5. Non-preemptive: executes until voluntarily gives up CPU finished or waits for some event.
6. Convoy Effect Problem: CPU bound process may execute a long CPU burst processes, so the
   processes with very short CPU bursts, wait in queue Reduces CPU and I/O device utilization.
   
   
IMPLEMENTATION :

1.Input the processes along with their burst time.
2.Find waiting time for all processes.
3.As first process that comes need not to wait,so wt[0]=0.
4.Find wt for all remaining processes i.e., wt[i] = bt[i-1] + wt[i-1].
5.Find tat = wt + bt for all processes.
6.Find average wt = total_wt / number of processes.
7.Find average tat = total_tat / number of processes.
